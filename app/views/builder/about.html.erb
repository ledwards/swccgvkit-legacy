	<h3>About swccgvkit online</h3>
	<p>
		swccgvkit online is designed and maintained by Lee Edwards as a free service to the
		Star Wars CCG community. The application is written using
		<%= link_to "Ruby on Rails", "http://www.rubyonrails.org", :popup => :true %>
		and is best-viewed using 
		<%= link_to "Firefox 3", "http://www.getfirefox.com", :popup => :true %>.
		
		We are currently in beta, which means that we are aggressively seeking
		<%= mail_to "lee@swccgvkit.com", "feedback" %> on our software and any new
		features that are released.
		Note that changes will be happening rather rapidly and the integrity of your saved data is not guaranteed.
